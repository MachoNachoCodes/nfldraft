AP CSP Exam Info: [https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/exam](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/exam)
  
For the full Create Task instructions see the Student Handouts PDF: [https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf)

Programming is a collaborative and creative process that brings ideas to life through
the development of software. In the Create performance task, you will design
and implement a program that might solve a problem, enable innovation, explore
personal interests, or express creativity. Your submission must include the elements
listed in the Submission Requirements section below.


You are allowed to collaborate with your partner(s) on the development of the
program only. The written response and the video that you submit for this
performance task must be completed individually, without any collaboration with
your partner(s) or anyone else. You can develop the code segments used in the
written responses (parts 3b and 3c) with your partner(s) or on your own during the
administration of the performance task.


Please note that once this performance task has been assigned as an assessment
for submission to College Board, you are expected to complete the task without
assistance from anyone except for your partner(s) and then only when developing
the program code. You must follow the Guidelines for Completing the Create
Performance Task section below.


## General Requirements

You will be provided with a minimum of 12 hours of class time to complete and
submit the following:

  - Final program code (created independently or collaboratively)

  - A video that displays the running of your program and demonstrates
functionality you developed (created independently)
  - Written responses to all the prompts in the performance task
(created independently)


Scoring guidelines and instructions for submitting your performance task are
available on the AP Computer Science Principles Exam page on AP Central.

Note: Students in nontraditional classroom environments should consult a
school-based AP Coordinator for instructions.



# Submission Requirements
### 1. PROGRAM CODE (CREATED INDEPENDENTLY OR COLLABORATIVELY)
   
Submit one PDF file that contains all of your program code (including
comments). Include comments or acknowledgments for any part of the
submitted program code that has been written by someone other than you
and/or your collaborative partner(s).

IMPORTANT:
If the programming environment allows you to include comments, this is the
preferred way to acknowledge and give credit to another author. However, if the
programming environment does not allow you to include comments, you can add
them in a document editor when you capture your program code for submission.

In your program, you must include student-developed program code that
contains the following:
- Instructions for input from one of the following:
   
    - the user (including user actions that trigger events)
    - a device
    - an online data stream
    - a file
      
- Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collection of
data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill
the program’s purpose

IMPORTANT:
The data abstraction must make the program easier to develop (alternatives would
be more complex) or easier to maintain (future changes to the size of the list would
otherwise require significant modifications to the program code).

- At least one procedure that contributes to the program’s intended purpose,
where you have defined:

  - the procedure’s name
  - the return type (if necessary)
  - one or more parameters
IMPORTANT:
Implementation of built-in or existing procedures or language structures, such as
event handlers or main methods, are not considered student-developed.
- An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration that is in the
body of the selected procedure
- Calls to your student-developed procedure
- Instructions for output (tactile, audible, visual, or textual) based on input and
program functionality

DEFINITION:

List

A list is an ordered
sequence of elements.
The use of lists allows
multiple related items
to be represented using
a single variable. Lists
may be referred to by
different names, such as
arrays, depending on the
programming language.

DEFINITION:

Collection Type

A collection type is a
type that aggregates
elements in a single
structure. Some
examples include lists,
databases, and sets.

IMPORTANT:
With text-based program
code, you can use the
print command to save
your program code as a
PDF file, or you can copy
and paste your code to a
text document and then
convert it into a PDF file.
With block-based
program code, you can
create screen captures
that include only your
program code, paste
these images into a
document, and then
convert that document
to a PDF. Screen
captures should not be
blurry, and text should be
at least 10 pt font size.

### 2. VIDEO (CREATED INDEPENDENTLY)
   
Submit one video file that demonstrates the running of your program as
described below. Collaboration is not allowed during the development of
your video.

Your video must demonstrate your program running, including:
- Input to your program
- At least one aspect of the functionality of your program
- Output produced by your program

Your video may NOT contain:
- Any distinguishing information about yourself
- Voice narration (though text captions are encouraged)
Your video must be:
- Either .mp4, .wmv, .avi, or .mov format
- No more than 1 minute in length
- No more than 30MB in file size

### 3. WRITTEN RESPONSES (CREATED INDEPENDENTLY)

Submit your responses to prompts 3a – 3d, which are described below. Your
response to all prompts combined must not exceed 750 words (program code
is not included in the word count). Collaboration is not allowed on the written
responses. Instructions for submitting your written responses are available on
the AP Computer Science Principles Exam Page on AP Central.

### 3 a. Provide a written response that does all three of the following:
Approx. 150 words (for all subparts of 3a combined)

i. Describes the overall purpose of the program

ii. Describes what functionality of the program is demonstrated in
the video

iii. Describes the input and output of the program demonstrated in
the video


### 3 b. Capture and paste two program code segments you developed during the administration of this task that contain a list (or other collection type) being used to manage complexity in your program.
Approx. 200 words (for all subparts of 3b combined, exclusive of
program code)

i. The first program code segment must show how data have been
stored in the list.

ii. The second program code segment must show the data in the
same list being used, such as creating new data from the existing
data or accessing multiple elements in the list, as part of fulfilling
the program’s purpose.

Then, provide a written response that does all three of the following:

iii. Identifies the name of the list being used in this response

iv. Describes what the data contained in the list represent in your
program

v. Explains how the selected list manages complexity in your program
code by explaining why your program code could not be written, or
how it would be written differently, if you did not use the list

DEFINITION:

List

A list is an ordered
sequence of elements.
The use of lists allows
multiple related items
to be represented using
a single variable. Lists
may be referred to by
different names, such as
arrays, depending on the
programming language.

DEFINITION:

Collection Type

A collection type is a type
that aggregates elements
in a single structure. Some
examples include lists,
databases, hash tables,
dictionaries, and sets.

IMPORTANT:
The data abstraction must
make the program easier
to develop (alternatives
would be more complex) or
easier to maintain (future
changes to the size of the
list would otherwise require
significant modifications to
the program code).


### 3 c. Capture and paste two program code segments you developed during the administration of this task that contain a student-developed procedure that implements an algorithm used in your program and a call to that procedure.
Approx. 200 words (for all subparts of 3c combined, exclusive of
program code)

i. The first program code segment must be a student-developed
procedure that:
- Defines the procedure’s name and return type (if necessary)
- Contains and uses one or more parameters that have an effect
on the functionality of the procedure
- Implements an algorithm that includes sequencing, selection,
and iteration

ii. The second program code segment must show where your
student-developed procedure is being called in your program.

Then, provide a written response that does both of the following:

iii. Describes in general what the identified procedure does and how it
contributes to the overall functionality of the program

iv. Explains in detailed steps how the algorithm implemented in the
identified procedure works. Your explanation must be detailed
enough for someone else to recreate it.

IMPORTANT:
Built-in or existing
procedures and
language structures,
such as event handlers
and main methods, are
not considered student developed.


### 3 d. Provide a written response that does all three of the following:
Approx. 200 words (for all subparts of 3d combined)

i. Describes two calls to the procedure identified in written response

3c. Each call must pass a different argument(s) that causes a
different segment of code in the algorithm to execute.

First call:

Second call:

ii. Describes what condition(s) is being tested by each call to the
procedure

Condition(s) tested by the first call:

Condition(s) tested by the second call:

iii. Identifies the result of each call

Result of the first call:

Result of the second call:
